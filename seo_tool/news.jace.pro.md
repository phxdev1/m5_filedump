Based on the analysis conducted using Lighthouse version 12.0.0 for the website https://news.jace.pro/, various key metrics and findings have been identified. Below is a detailed SEO analysis, along with actionable recommendations to address the identified issues.

### SEO Performance Overview
**Performance Score: 39%**  
**Best Practices Score: 55%**

### Key Metrics
1. **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** 2.9 seconds (54%)
   - **Recommendation:** Aim to improve FCP by optimizing the time it takes for the browser to render the first piece of content (text or image). Consider reducing the render-blocking resources and using asynchronous loading for CSS and JavaScript.

2. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** 5.7 seconds (17%)
   - **Recommendation:** Target an LCP of under 2.5 seconds. Improve by optimizing images, reducing server response times, and minifying CSS and JavaScript files.

3. **Speed Index:** 6.1 seconds (45%)
   - **Recommendation:** Improve the speed index by ensuring that all above-the-fold content is loaded quickly. Implement lazy loading for images and defer offscreen content.

4. **Total Blocking Time:** 5,350 milliseconds (0%)
   - **Recommendation:** Reduce the time that JavaScript or other resources block the main thread. Remove unused JavaScript, minimize third-party scripts, and use code-splitting.

5. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** 0 (100%)
   - This score is excellent. Maintain it by ensuring images, ads, and embeds have dimensions set, and avoid inserting content above existing content.

6. **Time to Interactive (TTI):** 10.6 seconds (23%)
   - **Recommendation:** Decrease TTI by optimizing JavaScript execution, removing unused scripts, and reducing the complexity of tasks executed.

### Additional Insights
- **No Browser Errors Logged:** There were no errors logged to the console, which is great for user experience (100%).
- **Initial Server Response Time:** 120 milliseconds (100%)
  - Good server performance. Maintain or improve further by using fast hosting and optimizing server-side applications.

### Detailed Recommendations

1. **Optimize Resource Loading**
   - **Images:** Use modern formats (like WebP), compress images, and ensure dimensions are set to avoid layout shifts.
   - **Fonts:** Preload key fonts and use font-display: swap.
   - **JavaScript:** Minimize third-party scripts. Use async/defer for non-critical scripts.
   - **CSS:** Minify CSS files and consider splitting critical CSS to inline first.

2. **Reduce Main-thread Work**
   - Identify long main-thread tasks and break them down. Use tools like Chrome DevTools to analyze performance bottlenecks.
   - Implement efficient JavaScript techniques.

3. **Implement Efficient Caching and Compression**
   - Use caching strategies for static assets to reduce load times for returning users.
   - Enable Gzip or Brotli compression to decrease file sizes.

4. **Improve Server Response and Delivery**
   - Use a CDN to serve static resources.
   - Optimize server performance by upgrading infrastructure if needed and ensuring efficient backend processes.

5. **Monitor Third-party Scripts**
   - Third-party scripts, particularly those from HubSpot, significantly impact performance. Consider loading them after your main content or deferring them.

6. **Lazy Loading for Below-the-fold Content**
   - Implement lazy loading for images and other media assets that are not in the initial viewport to speed up the initial page load.

### Summary of Resource Summary
- **Total Requests:** 16
- **Scripts:** 6 (458,279 bytes)
- **Images:** 2 (6,959 bytes)
- **Third-party Requests:** 6

### Third-party Impact
- **Blocking Time from Third-party Resources:** 10 ms
- **Recommendation:** Minimize third-party requests and ensure they load efficiently.

### Conclusion
Significant improvements are needed in reducing the total blocking time, improving first and largest contentful paint times, and achieving a faster time to interactive. Focus on optimizing images, JavaScript, CSS, and leveraging modern web performance practices. Regularly monitor performance metrics and iterate on improvements to ensure better user experience and performance scores.

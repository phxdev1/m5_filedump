Based on the Lighthouse SEO analysis of https://news.jace.pro/, here are some critical findings and recommendations:

### Performance Overview:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** 2.9 seconds (Score: 0.54)
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** 5.7 seconds (Score: 0.17)
- **Speed Index:** 6.1 seconds (Score: 0.45)
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** 5.35 seconds (Score: 0)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** 0 (Score: 1)
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** 10.6 seconds (Score: 0.23)

### Key SEO Metrics:
1. **First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
   - Both FCP and LCP scores are below average. Improve these metrics by optimizing server response time, minimizing render-blocking resources, and preloading important resources. Pay particular attention to the LCP element identified as `div.css-j7qwjs > h2.chakra-heading > a > p.chakra-text`.

2. **Speed Index**
   - A Speed Index of 6.1 seconds indicates it takes considerable time for the page to become visually complete. Similar to FCP and LCP, this can be improved through the strategies mentioned above.

3. **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**
   - TBT is significantly high. Reducing JavaScript execution time, breaking up long tasks, and optimizing third-party scripts can help lower TBT.

4. **Time to Interactive (TTI)**
   - Achieving interactivity at 10.6 seconds is below acceptable standards. Work on reducing JavaScript execution, optimizing main-thread work, and deferring unused JavaScript.

5. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**
   - CLS score is perfect, indicating that your layout stability is very good. Continue maintaining this by setting explicit width and height for images and other elements.

### Issues & Opportunities:
- **Errors in Console:**
  - No browser errors were logged, which is excellent.
  
- **Server Response Time:**
  - The initial server response time is good at 123.37 ms.

- **Redirects:**
  - No multiple page redirects were noted, which is good for performance.

- **Third-Party Cookies:**
  - Two third-party cookies were identified. Ensure that third-party scripts and cookies are essential for functionality.

### Network and Resource Utilization:
- **Total Resources:**
  - The site has a reasonable total transfer size of 582.82 KB, but heavy scripts amounting to 458.28 KB can be optimized.
- **Scripts:**
  - Several scripts from third-party sources, particularly from HubSpot, contribute to performance lags. Consider asynchronously loading third-party scripts or deferring them until necessary.

### Actionable Recommendations:
1. **Optimize and Defer JavaScript:**
   - Minimize, defer, and asynchronously load third-party scripts. Split code into smaller bundles to reduce blocking time.
  
2. **Improve Initial Server Response:**
   - Although generally good, always look for ways to improve server response time. Explore using server-side rendering techniques.
   
3. **Optimize Images and Static Assets:**
   - Ensure images are compressed and served in the next-gen formats (like WebP). Also, take advantage of lazy loading for offscreen images.

4. **Reduce Render-Blocking Resources:**
   - Inline critical CSS and defer non-essential CSS and JavaScript to improve FCP and LCP.

5. **Third-Party Scripts:**
   - Evaluate the necessity of these scripts. Eliminate redundant scripts and load essential scripts asynchronously.

6. **Leverage Browser Caching:**
   - Set appropriate cache policies for static resources to ensure that resources arenâ€™t fetch unnecessarily.

7. **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN):**
   - Distribute content more efficiently and reduce server response time by using a CDN.

By addressing these recommendations, you can significantly improve the performance and SEO scores for https://news.jace.pro/, ensuring a better user experience and higher search engine rankings.
